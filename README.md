### Project Objective
Tasked with the responsibity of preparing a Power BI dashboard for visualizing energy consumption trends and making future predictions

### Dataset
The given Dataset contains key metrics for 5 years that needs to be tracked and analyzed such as Energy Consumption, Historical Energy Consumption, Weather Condition, Temperature e.t.c and seek to answer some important questions such as finding seasonal patterns in energy consumption over the years and how the consumption of energy is affected by external factors like temperature, humidity, or weather conditions

### Data Analysis
**INSIGHTS**
- Total Energy Consumption
- Average Energy Consumption
- Total Energy Consumption by Top 5 Appliance Usage
- Energy Consumption by Occupancy
- Energy Consumption by Temperature
- Energy Consumption by Weather Condition
- Energy Consumption by Quarters

### Data Visualization
- Microsoft Power BI

### Data Report

- Across the Top 5 Appliance Usage (kWh), Total Energy Consumption ranged from 3262 to 3495.

- Appliances with 2.58 kWh had the highest Energy Consumption at 3495, accounting for 20.71% of the Total Energy Consumption, and was 7.14% higher than Appliances with 4.95 kWh, which had the lowest Energy Consumption at 3262.

- The report shows how energy consumption is affected by external factors like temperature and weather condition.

- More energy was consumed when the temperature was between 10-15 degree Celsius at 287,168 than when it was between 31-35 at 194,228.

- Similarly, More energy was consumed when the weather was Rainy at 303,193 than when it was Clear at 297,184.

- Across all 11 Occupancy; Occupancy "10" (accounting for 9.45% of the Total Energy Consumption) had the highest Energy Consumption at 113811, and was 6.76% higher than Occupancy "0", which had the lowest Total Energy Consumption at 106,605.﻿

- The Total Energy Consumption given was 1M having an Average Consumption of 301K by Quarters.

- SNCO had the highest Total Energy Consumption at 302,572 (followed by CBQ, SOQ, and MOQ), and was 1.20% higher than MOQ, which had the lowest Energy Consumption at 298,974.

- Across all 4 Quarters, Total Energy Consumption ranged from 298,974 to 302,572 with ﻿SNCO accounting for 25.12% of Total Energy Consumption.
